### Project Planning and Development for a README Generator

#### **1. Project Planning**

**A. Define Project Scope:**
   - **Objective:** Create a command-line application that generates a professional `README.md` file based on user input.
   - **Features:**
     - Prompt user for project details.
     - Generate a structured `README.md` file.
     - Include clickable links in the Table of Contents.
     - Provide license badge and information.
     - Easy-to-use command-line interface.

**B. Project Milestones:**
   - **Milestone 1:** Set up the project environment.
   - **Milestone 2:** Implement user input prompts.
   - **Milestone 3:** Generate `README.md` file with basic structure.
   - **Milestone 4:** Add advanced features (license badge, Table of Contents links).
   - **Milestone 5:** Test the application thoroughly.
   - **Milestone 6:** Finalize and document the project.

**C. Tools and Technologies:**
   - **Languages:** JavaScript (Node.js)
   - **Libraries:** `inquirer` for user input, `fs` for file system operations.
   - **Version Control:** Git and GitHub.
   - **Text Editor:** VSCode.
   - **Testing:** Manual testing to ensure correct output.

**D. Timeline:**
   - **Week 1:** Set up the environment and create basic CLI application.
   - **Week 2:** Implement user input and basic README generation.
   - **Week 3:** Add advanced features (license badge, links).
   - **Week 4:** Test, refine, and document the project.

#### **2. Development Process**

**A. Milestone 1: Set Up Project Environment**
   - **Create a new GitHub repository:**
     - Initialize with a `README.md`.
     - Clone the repository locally.
   - **Set up Node.js project:**
     - Initialize Node.js with `npm init`.
     - Install necessary packages:
       - `inquirer` for user prompts: `npm install inquirer`.
       - `chalk` for styling the CLI output (optional).
   - **Create project structure:**
     - Root directory:
       - `index.js` (Main file)
       - `/utils` (Utility functions for generating README sections)

**B. Milestone 2: Implement User Input Prompts**
   - **In `index.js`:**
     - Import `inquirer` and set up prompts for each section:
       - Project title
       - Description
       - Installation
       - Usage
       - Contributing
       - Tests
       - License choice
       - GitHub username
       - Email address
     - Store user inputs in a structured object.

**C. Milestone 3: Generate `README.md` File**
   - **Create utility functions in `/utils`:**
     - `generateMarkdown.js`:
       - Function to create markdown content based on user inputs.
       - Return a string with the full `README.md` content.
     - **In `index.js`:**
       - Import `fs` to write the content to a `README.md` file.
       - Call `generateMarkdown` with user inputs and write the result to the file.

**D. Milestone 4: Add Advanced Features**
   - **License Badge:**
     - Use the selected license to generate a badge URL.
     - Add the badge at the top of the `README.md`.
   - **Table of Contents Links:**
     - In `generateMarkdown.js`, include markdown links in the Table of Contents.
     - Ensure the links navigate to the correct sections.

**E. Milestone 5: Testing**
   - **Manual Testing:**
     - Run the CLI tool with different inputs.
     - Verify that all sections are correctly populated.
     - Check that Table of Contents links are functional.
     - Ensure the license badge appears and is correctly linked.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - Test with empty inputs.
     - Test with different license choices.

**F. Milestone 6: Finalize and Document**
   - **Refine Code:**
     - Clean up and refactor code for readability and efficiency.
     - Ensure all functions are well-documented.
   - **Create Documentation:**
     - Update the `README.md` of the project itself to include:
       - How to install and use the tool.
       - Contribution guidelines.
       - License information.
   - **Push to GitHub:**
     - Ensure all code and documentation are pushed to the repository.
   - **Release:**
     - Tag the version and create a release on GitHub.

#### **3. Post-Development**
   - **Share the Project:**
     - Share the project on social media, forums, or communities.
   - **Gather Feedback:**
     - Request feedback from other developers or peers.
   - **Iterate and Improve:**
     - Based on feedback, consider adding more features or fixing any identified issues.
